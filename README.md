# improved-foldtext.vim

Minor foldtext improvements inspired by [vim-markdown-folding](https://github.com/nelstrom/vim-markdown-folding).

Improvements include:
* The number of folddashes is the foldlevel.
* Each folddash is replaced with the current buffer's comment string.
* The line count is placed after the fold text.
